.SH NAME
ec2ifscan - find and configure elastic network interfaces

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ec2ifscan

.SH DESCRIPTION
Elastic network interfaces require the instance metadata service to be reachable
for correct configuration in the general case, which requires at least one
active network interface. This condition may not be met for interfaces attached
at instance launch time. Consequently, those interfaces can remain unconfigured.

The
.B ec2ifscan
command may be used to find and configure elastic network interfaces in an
unconfigured state. An interface is considered to be unconfigured if the link
is down, and no configuration exists in /etc/sysconfig/network/.

A hotplug \fBadd\fR event is generated for each unconfigured interface that is
found. This provides another opportunity for udev rules to automatically
configure and activate the elastic network interface.
