.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ec2ifup IFACE

.B ec2ifdown IFACE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ec2ifup
and
.B ec2ifdown
commands may be used to configure (or, respectively, deconfigure) a network
interface based on its definition in the instance metadata store. The resulting
configuration will be stored in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.

These scripts take one argument: the name of the network interface (e.g. eth0).
If the configuration for this interface is present and defines EC2SYNC=no, the
scripts will exit without making changes. Otherwise, the configuration will be
replaced or removed.
